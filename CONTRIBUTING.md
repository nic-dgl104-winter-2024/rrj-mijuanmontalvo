# About CONTRIBUTING.md file

**URL:** https://github.com/mijuanmontalvo/platform/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md


## Summary of what you learned about the Contributing.md file

In the Ushahidi project there is a file Contributing.md in which they indicate the following:
  "There are many ways to get involved with Ushahidi projects, and some of them are great even for first time contributors. If you never contributed to Open Source Software before, or need more guidance doing it, please jump in our gitter channel with a clear description of what you are trying to do, and someone in there will try to help you."

As seen in the file, the Ushahidi project is very open to external contributions and they even have a Gitter channel where they can guide how to contribute even if a person has never made a contribution.

On the other hand, in the Contributing.md file they indicate that it is possible to contribute in many ways, for example with documentation, Report a bug, Fix a bug, New features, Security issues, etc.

Additionally, in this project there is a code of conduct that describes the way in which people should make their comments, contributions, etc. The code of conduct also refers to conflicts of interest when carrying out an evaluation on someone who breached the code of conduct.

In general, I find this type of document very appropriate and very necessary for the contributors and collaborators of the project to read this type of document before starting to get involved in the project. This will help maintain a good collaborative environment in the project.

I consider that even though the text of the Contributing.md file is small, it is also very concise and makes it very clear that the project is very open to receiving external contributions.

I would like to review the next issue: [Outreachy Task Submission] Grammatical Error and Capitalization Error in the error message when adding a new post #4794. This issue is in the repository of (ushahidi/platform)[https://github.com/ushahidi/platform]

Below is the text that describes the issue:

**URL Issue:** [https://github.com/ushahidi/platform/](https://github.com/ushahidi/platform/issues/4794)

**Author:** Gbolahan Oladeji

**Issue description:**

the error message when adding a new post is "Failed to create a post. please recheck the your input"

Grammatical error: "please recheck the your input." The word "the" before "your input" is redundant and should be removed for correct grammar. The correct form should be: "please recheck your input."
Capitalization error: The please in the statement should start in capital letter 'P'.

I would like to review this issue and search a possible solution.

When I was reviewing the repository documentation to try to resolve issue #4794, I tried to access the link [Installation guides](https://docs.ushahidi.com/platform-developer-documentation/development-and-code/setup_alternatives) which is located in the REASDME.md file, however this link takes me to a page that has a message that it could not be found the page
