# About CONTRIBUTING.md file

**URL:** https://github.com/mijuanmontalvo/platform/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md


## Summary of what you learned about the Contributing.md file

In the Ushahidi project there is a file Contributing.md in which they indicate the following:
  "There are many ways to get involved with Ushahidi projects, and some of them are great even for first time contributors. If you never contributed to Open Source Software before, or need more guidance doing it, please jump in our gitter channel with a clear description of what you are trying to do, and someone in there will try to help you."

As seen in the file, the Ushahidi project is very open to external contributions and they even have a Gitter channel where they can guide how to contribute even if a person has never made a contribution.

On the other hand, in the Contributing.md file they indicate that it is possible to contribute in many ways, for example with documentation, Report a bug, Fix a bug, New features, Security issues, etc.

Additionally, in this project there is a code of conduct that describes the way in which people should make their comments, contributions, etc. The code of conduct also refers to conflicts of interest when carrying out an evaluation on someone who breached the code of conduct.

In general, I find this type of document very appropriate and very necessary for the contributors and collaborators of the project to read this type of document before starting to get involved in the project. This will help maintain a good collaborative environment in the project.

I consider that even though the text of the Contributing.md file is small, it is also very concise and makes it very clear that the project is very open to receiving external contributions.

#### Issue #4794 of Ushahidi Platform

I checked the [issue #4794](https://github.com/ushahidi/platform/issues/4794), which has the following detail:

**Title:** [Outreachy Task Submission] Grammatical Error and Capitalization Error in the error message when adding a new post

**Issue Description:** the error message when adding a new post is "Failed to create a post. please recheck the your input"  

Grammatical error: "please recheck the your input." The word "the" before "your input" is redundant and should be removed for correct grammar. The correct form should be: "please recheck your input."
Capitalization error: The please in the statement should start in capital letter 'P'.

**Author:** Gbolahan Oladeji

**Actions done:** When I was reviewing the repository documentation to try to resolve issue #4794, I tried to access the link [Installation guides] which is within the REAADME.md file located at the root of the repository, however when I click on this link it takes me to a page that has a message that the page was not found "Page not found The page you are looking for doesn't exist."

#### Issue #4794 of Ushahidi Platform

Since I found the problem detailed in the previous paragraph, I decided to try to contribute by reporting the problem of this link. So I created an issue in the (real) Ushahidi Platform repository, below is a detail of the issue that I uploaded:

Issue number: #4846
Issue Description: Good morning everyone, I am interested in knowing more about the Ushahidi project, however, I was reading the README.md file and I tried to enter the "Installation guides" link in the Useful Links section and I got the following message "Page not found Sorry."

Issue URL: https://github.com/ushahidi/platform (README.md)

Impact: Users who cannot find this file may feel misplaced and lost when trying to install Ushahidi

Possible solution: I consider that the file associated with "Installation guides" is not correctly located or was deleted, perhaps it is necessary to load that file again.
