# Week - 8

## Research a new language - Processing

During the class on Monday, February 26, 2024, my work team investigated information about the "Processing" programming language, for which we answered the following questions related to "Processing"


**What is the language used for?**

Processing is a programming language used to create visual arts projects and interactive visualization projects with animations.

**Who uses the language?**

Processing is used mainly by artists and designers, however this language also is used by beginners in programming and by educators to teach concepts of programming within a visual context

**What are some useful resources?**

 https://processing.org/- The official Processing site offers comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and references that are ideal for beginners.
processing/processing-website: Repository for processing.org (github.com) - Processing repository on GitHub.
https://discourse.processing.org/ - Processing Forum

**Why are these specific resources useful?**

In these places it is possible to find information for those who want to learn this language: manuals, tutorials, general information, it is also possible to enter the forum to ask any questions about the language.

**Reflection**

Processing is a specialized language for visual arts projects. I did a quick search for information on the Processing programming language and found interesting information. I have learned that there are different languages for specific projects and that there is valuable information on the Internet.

## Write a user story

An application that I use regularly is MonTransit, below is my user story

**Main user story**

As a user of the MonTransit app I want to find the schedules of the Comox Valley bus routes.

**User story (1)**

As a MonTransit user, I can see that the application has a section about the total schedules of each bus route.

*Acceptance criteria:* there is a button for entering in each bus route and each stop bus.

**User story (2)**

As a MonTransit user, I can see that the application has a map where it indices the locations of stop bus.

*Acceptance criteria:* On each stop bus in map there is a tag with its address


## Choose a language for community code

I would like to focus on the PHP programming language. 

Last semester I took the course "Introduction to PHP", in this course I developed a small project, I do not have much experience in this programming language, however I liked the results that can be achieved with this language. 

I would like to learn more about this programming language because it works very well with HTML and with databases (free software) like MYSQL. I consider it to be a very good option for building web applications. I like to make queries in databases and I believe that this would be good practice.

## Star github topics and repositories of interest

In order to prepare for the Community Code project, I have visited the https://github.com/explore on this website and reviewed the following tabs:

- https://github.com/topics
- https://github.com/trending
- https://github.com/collections

On this website I applied several "PHP" filters to which I obtained many options of repositories related to PHP projects.


# Week 9

## Read the community code assignment

This assignment is composed of two parts. I will have to contribute to both parts, however I will only have to contribute code to one of them (other contributions include improving documentation, issue management and classification, bug reporting, site development, etc.)

In Part 2 I will also have to contribute to a true open source community. I will contribute to the DGL 104 pattern library repository to help produce a code resource for potential future DGL 104 students.

## Read “HOW TO CONTRIBUTE TO OPEN SOURCE”


Contributing to open source can be a rewarding way to learn, teach, and gain experience in virtually any skill you can imagine.

Here are some reasons why people contribute to open source:

- Improve software you rely on
- Improve existing skills
- Meet people who are interested in similar things
- Find mentors and teach others
- Build public artifacts that help you grow a reputation (and a career)
- Learn people skills
- It’s empowering to be able to make changes, even small ones

There are all kinds of ways to get involved in an open source project, and a few tips will help you get the most out of your experience. It is possible to contribute in several ways to a project not only in the code. Here are some ways to contribute to a project:

- Organize events that contribute to the project.
- Improvements to the project design.
- Write tutorials and documentation for the project.
- Organize project information.
- Contribute with user tests
- Review project code and recommend improvements.

In conclusion, it is possible to contribute to a project in various ways not only through the code, the important thing is to understand that the contribution will help the project, its readers and will also help the person contributing with practice and learning.

## Find potential projects to contribute to

Below are three PHP projects that I selected to review their information:

**Project 1:** phpDocumentor

URL Github: https://github.com/phpDocumentor/phpDocumentor

I chose this project because it is a project that has 157 contributors, 154 issues and records recent updates. phpDocumentor stands as the de-facto documentation tool for PHP projects, offering a robust solution for generating comprehensive documentation effortlessly. By analyzing your PHP source code and DocBlock comments, phpDocumentor generates a complete set of API documentation, making it an indispensable tool for developers striving for clear and well-documented codebases.tool for developers striving for clear and well-documented codebases.

**Project 2:** Ushahidi

URL Github: https://github.com/ushahidi/platform
